# FileNamer.jl

Julia package to assist with log and data file management.
The use case is situations in which many data files or 
recordings are made, and they need timestamped filenames
and folders, alongs with some sequential naming in some cases.

Package is somewhat opinionated, but gives lots of 
configurability to the time and date formats used.
